How can primary education in the U.S. be improved? These are three specific components of a child's primary education whose effectiveness I believe we need to carefully assess and have the potential for reform and improvement.

##1. Parental involvement in Primary Education
To what extent are parents involved in their children's primary education? How does parental involvement affect primary education? If the current primary education system at large lacks parental involvement, in what ways should we encourage or even require the parents of students to supplement their education? By looking at how much and in what ways parental involvement varies across the country as well as the resulting performance, I hope to find answers to these questions.


##2. Standardized testing in Primary Education



##3. Recess in Primary Education
