##Springboard Data Science Intensive Chapter 1: Project Ideas

How can primary education in the U.S. be improved? These are three specific components of a child's primary education whose effectiveness I believe we need to carefully assess and have the potential for reform and improvement.


##1. Parental involvement in Primary Education
To what extent are parents involved in their children's primary education? How does parental involvement affect primary education? If the current primary education system at large lacks parental involvement, in what ways should we encourage or even require the parents of students to supplement their education? By looking at how much and in what ways parental involvement varies across the country as well as the resulting performance, I hope to find answers to these questions.


##2. Standardized testing in Primary Education
How does standardized testing during primary education affect a child's learning? Does the routinization of standardized testing in primary education have an impact on people's lives long after primary education and how so? By comparing primary schools in which children do and do not receive standardized testing and studying those students longitudinally, I hope to determine whether standardized testing is a worthwhile investment and if it is, how we can best utilize it.


##3. Recess in Primary Education
How does recess affect a child's education? What is the importance of unstructured, exploratory learning in comparison to standardized, academic learning and how can it be implemented through recess? By looking at the various ways in which students experience recess across the country and their development of non-academic skills, I hope to determine general guidelines for how recess should be conducted for optimal non-academic learning.
